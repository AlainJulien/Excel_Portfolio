This file serves as explanations to any Excel analysis/dashboards files posted under my Github.

The initial project Bike Buyers was done to assess bikes being bought in different states by different age groups.
The slicers can be used to select different regions and varying statuses such as home owners, age bracket or education.

The second project (posted as an image to avoid any issue with the original site) is a finanacial dashbaord created just with a bit more complexity.

The third project is with a data set off Kaggle called the coffee prices historical chart data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/williamriveraramos/coffee-prices-historical).
Here, I created a simple dashboard that tracked and showed the changes in coffee prices form 1973 onwards in a monthly or yearly format with simple bar graphs
and line charts.

Stay tuned for more.
